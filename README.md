# WeWork
This is the demand forecasting project I've done at WeWork. The project aims to incorporate market demand and 'community sense' into predicting WeWork's building occupancy and empowering pricing strategies. 

The data cleaning & manipulation pseudo-code can be found in the SQL file while the feature engineering and model training pseudo-codes can be found in the R file. The models explored are the linear regression, random forest and XGBoost.

The XGBoost model learns the metrics on market demand, location attributes, and historic performance. The average prediction errors is less than 3.2%.
